Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nGeneral Help with Research and Writing\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

For example, would making the color words bigger make it even harder to ignore the words, and therefore produce a larger Stroop effect (compared to trials where the words were much smaller and harder to read, and therefore easier to ignore)?\nProduce a version of the Stroop experiment that deploys your manipulation. In the example above, you would need to have some trials where the word appears in a small font and others where it appears in a large font.\n\n\nAdvanced\nWe will cover data analysis next week, but if you want to find out whether your manipulation worked, then you will need to analyze your data in each condition.

We will spend the next few weeks learning about this model, and eventually using it to make predictions about recognition memory for pictures.\nHere is a general plan for the next three weeks:\nWeek A: Get some general familiarity with the model. This will involve reading a couple papers about the MINERVA II model, and working through a learning module about this topic that I developed for an intro to cognition course. Attempt to implement a really basic version of the model in Microsoft Excel or Google sheets by following a tutorial\nWeek B: Follow along with a tutorial that I will post about how to implement a MINERVA II model in the R programming language. Our goal will be to model a generic recognition memory procedure. We will create a set of items, present the model with some of the items, and then give it a recognition memory to see if it can tell the difference between new and old items\nWeek C: By week 3 we should be in a position to put digital representations of pictures into a MINERVA II memory model, and then simulate a recognition memory procedure for pictures. This simulation will allow us to make predictions from the theory about performance in picture recognition memory tasks.\nLet’s get started."

The purpose of your experiment proposal is to brainstorm a way to test the limits of this memorability effect.\nOne example that we discussed in class was the idea of within-subject test-retest reliability. For example, if we ran a version of the above experiment on the same group of people twice, would they find a high correlation between the picture memorability rankings on the first and second test? According to the notion that some pictures are inherently more memorable than others, we would expect a relatively strong positive correlation.\nYour task to consider other potential ways to test the limits of the memorability effect. This would involve running a similar kind of experiment as above, but manipulating some additional aspects to determine how stable or generalizable the effect is to other conditions.\nHave fun, and it is OK to brainstorm more than one experiment idea."

Once I have a finalized version I will email you all a link to try the study one more time, and we will look at the data next week.\nIn addition, the assignment for this week is for you to do a little bit of research yourself, this time on rotation and orientation effects.\nMany studies have shown that inverted or rotated stimuli may impair memory. Your first task is to read the very short paper (which is attached and in the zotero group library):\nScapinello, K. F., & Yarmey, A. D. (1970). The role of familiarity and orientation in immediate and delayed recognition of pictorial stimuli.

    "section": "Advanced",
    "text": "Advanced\nThis section is not required, but may be of some interest (e.g., you could decide to work on this problem this week instead of the above). In a continuous recognition procedure items are presented one at time and a participants judges whether the item is new or old. A new item is one that has never been presented before. An old item is a repetition of a previously presented item.\nThe experiment that we tried in class was an example of a continuous recognition procedure. One of the issues with this design is controlling the mixture of new and old items in the sequence of trials. In our pilot experiment, there was a noticeable bias in our sequence. Specifically, most of the early trials were new items and most of later trials were old items.\nThe advanced problem is to consider our approach to the sequencing of new and old items. Ideally, we should be able to control:\n\nThe proportion of new and old items (e.g. 50% each).\nThe lag between repetitions. That is how many other items are between first and second presentations.\nAvoiding long runs of all new or all old\n\nHere is an example approach that solves some of the problem, but not all of them.\nLet’s say we have 100 pictures, represented here by the numbers 1 to 100\n\nall_pictures &lt;- 1:100\n\nI will use R to duplicate the set of numbers, and then randomly shuffle the order. This process ensures that each item (1 to 100) is presented twice in a random order. As a result, there would be 100 new trials (the first time you see a particular number), and 100 old trials (the second time you a particular number).\n\ntrial_sequence &lt;- sample(c(1:100,1:100))\n\nHowever, simply shuffling the values randomly produces some other issues. The code chunk below analyzes the above 200 trial sequence to determine whether a particular trial is a new or old item.

The beginning shouldn’t be mostly new items, and the end shouldn’t be mostly old.\nMore control over the lags between first and second presentation of an item. For example, all items might have a minimum lag of 50 or greater.\n\nI’ll be working on solutions to this problem, and feel free to try your own as your work for this week. The solution to this type of problem requires an algorithm for mixing the items, and then some analysis of the sequence to show that it expresses the desired properties.\nOne of the papers in our zotero group library used a continuous recognition procedure, and their method section describes an approach that involves “test” items, and “filler” items.

    "text": "Updates\nHere’s what I came up with.\n\nVerbal description of algorithm\nThis algorithm is designed to create a sequence of items with specific characteristics:\n\nChoose a total of “n” items to be presented twice, for example, selecting 200 pictures for double presentation.\nDefine a minimum and maximum lag range, representing the number of items between the first and second presentation (e.g., a lag range of 50 to 100).\nCalculate the total number of trials as the product of the number of pictures (n) times 2, and then add the maximum lag range (e.g., 200 * 2 + 100 = 500 trials).\nRandomly distribute the first occurrences of the items within the first 400 trials (considering the maximum lag range) to avoid exceeding the trial limit.\nAssign the remaining unassigned spots in the sequence to the second occurrences of each item. Iterate through the sequence, and for each first-occurrence item, find open positions within the specified lag range. Randomly choose one and fill it with the second occurrence of the current item. Repeat this process throughout the sequence.\nAny remaining unassigned spots will be filled with “filler” items. The aim is to balance the beginning and end of the sequence to avoid bias toward new or old items. Here’s how it’s done:\n\nFiller items are introduced, which are additional items.\nA small window of filler items is selected (e.g., four filler items).\nThe array of filler items is doubled, and the order is shuffled (e.g., 1,2,3,4,1,2,3,4 -&gt; 1,3,2,2,4,3,1,4).\nFiller items are assigned to the missing values in the trial sequence based on these shuffled indices.\nThis process is repeated across the entire sequence to incorporate new sets of filler items.\n\n\nIn summary, the algorithm is designed to generate a sequence of items, ensuring that first and second occurrences of items are appropriately spaced and filling any gaps with filler items to avoid bias of old vs new items at the beginning and end of the sequence.\n\n\nR code version\n\n# set total number of items that will be repeated\nn_items &lt;- 200\n# set range of possible lags\nlag_range &lt;- c(50,100)\n# calculate total_trials needed\ntotal_trials &lt;- (n_items*2)+lag_range[2]\n\n# spread out the first occurrences of each item across the first 400 positions. This ensures a relatively uniform mixture of new items across the first 400 trials.\n# initial_spread has 500 slots, 1s are randomly assigned to 200 positions within the first 400 slots. 0s are assigned everywhere else.\n# 1s indicate that an item will receive its first presentation in that slot\ninitial_spread &lt;- c(sample(c(rep(1,200),rep(0,200))),rep(0,100)) \n\n# create an empty vector to hold the trial sequence. \n# The trial sequence will also have 500 slots, each slot will be filled with a integer representing a specific item (from 1 to 200, and greater than 200 for filler items)\nsequence &lt;- c()\n\n# assign first occurrences of each of the 200 items to the locations that had 1s.\nsequence[which(initial_spread == 1)] &lt;- 1:200\n\n# get available spots, these are spots with 0s\navailable &lt;- which(initial_spread == 0)\n\n# create a vector to hold items that have already been presented twice\nold &lt;- c()\n\n# loop across each item in sequence\nfor(i in 1:length(sequence)){\n  # make sure item is an integer\n  if(is.na(sequence[i]) == FALSE){ \n    # make sure item hasn't been presented twice already\n    if(sequence[i] %in% old == FALSE){ \n      # whatever item this is will be presented twice, add it to old\n      old &lt;- c(old,sequence[i])\n      # get possible open spots that are within the lag range\n      possible_spots &lt;- available[available &gt;
