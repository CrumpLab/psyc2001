The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\nMissing an Exam\nNote there are no exams in this course.\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nGeneral Help with Research and Writing\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

In our meeting yesterday we tried a pilot version of a continuous recognition memory procedure for pictures with different levels of noise added.\nI am still in the process of addressing some of the design issues in that experiment that we discussed, and I expect to be finished with that by early next week. Once I have a finalized version I will email you all a link to try the study one more time, and we will look at the data next week.\nIn addition, the assignment for this week is for you to do a little bit of research yourself, this time on rotation and orientation effects.\nMany studies have shown that inverted or rotated stimuli may impair memory. Your first task is to read the very short paper (which is attached and in the zotero group library):\nScapinello, K. F., & Yarmey, A. D. (1970). The role of familiarity and orientation in immediate and delayed recognition of pictorial stimuli. Psychonomic Science, 21(6), 329–330.\nThen use google scholar, or some other method (e.g., the references from the above paper), to find another paper investigating how rotation or inversion may impact recognition memory.\nMake a blog post taking notes about the paper, and describing the extra paper that you found. After we finish the pictures in noise experiment, we’ll move on to making an experiment that attempts to replicate rotation effects."

    "section": "Advanced",
    "text": "Advanced\nThis section is not required, but may be of some interest (e.g., you could decide to work on this problem this week instead of the above). In a continuous recognition procedure items are presented one at time and a participants judges whether the item is new or old. A new item is one that has never been presented before. An old item is a repetition of a previously presented item.\nThe experiment that we tried in class was an example of a continuous recognition procedure. One of the issues with this design is controlling the mixture of new and old items in the sequence of trials. In our pilot experiment, there was a noticeable bias in our sequence. Specifically, most of the early trials were new items and most of later trials were old items.\nThe advanced problem is to consider our approach to the sequencing of new and old items. Ideally, we should be able to control:\n\nThe proportion of new and old items (e.g. 50% each).\nThe lag between repetitions. That is how many other items are between first and second presentations.\nAvoiding long runs of all new or all old\n\nHere is an example approach that solves some of the problem, but not all of them.\nLet’s say we have 100 pictures, represented here by the numbers 1 to 100\n\nall_pictures &lt;- 1:100\n\nI will use R to duplicate the set of numbers, and then randomly shuffle the order. This process ensures that each item (1 to 100) is presented twice in a random order. As a result, there would be 100 new trials (the first time you see a particular number), and 100 old trials (the second time you a particular number).\n\ntrial_sequence &lt;- sample(c(1:100,1:100))\n\nHowever, simply shuffling the values randomly produces some other issues. The code chunk below analyzes the above 200 trial sequence to determine whether a particular trial is a new or old item. If the item is old, the lag between presentations is also computed.\n\ndf &lt;- data.frame()\nfor(i in 1:200){\n  num_positions &lt;- which(trial_sequence %in% trial_sequence[i])\n  if(i == num_positions[1]) {\n    type &lt;- \"new\"\n    lag &lt;- NA\n  }\n  if(i == num_positions[2]) {\n    type &lt;- \"old\"\n    lag &lt;- num_positions[2] - num_positions[1]\n  }\n  t_df &lt;- data.frame(trial = i,\n                     item = trial_sequence[i],\n                     type = type,\n                     lag = lag\n                     )\n  df &lt;-  rbind(df,t_df)\n}\n\nThis results in a data frame codes properties of the trial sequence. Notice that most of the beginning trials are new items, and most of the ending trials are old items.\n\nknitr::kable(df)\n\n\n\n\ntrial\nitem\ntype\nlag\n\n\n\n\n1\n8\nnew\nNA\n\n\n2\n12\nnew\nNA\n\n\n3\n75\nnew\nNA\n\n\n4\n42\nnew\nNA\n\n\n5\n70\nnew\nNA\n\n\n6\n84\nnew\nNA\n\n\n7\n6\nnew\nNA\n\n\n8\n25\nnew\nNA\n\n\n9\n54\nnew\nNA\n\n\n10\n32\nnew\nNA\n\n\n11\n11\nnew\nNA\n\n\n12\n98\nnew\nNA\n\n\n13\n21\nnew\nNA\n\n\n14\n69\nnew\nNA\n\n\n15\n15\nnew\nNA\n\n\n16\n4\nnew\nNA\n\n\n17\n92\nnew\nNA\n\n\n18\n82\nnew\nNA\n\n\n19\n48\nnew\nNA\n\n\n20\n96\nnew\nNA\n\n\n21\n52\nnew\nNA\n\n\n22\n8\nold\n21\n\n\n23\n9\nnew\nNA\n\n\n24\n80\nnew\nNA\n\n\n25\n40\nnew\nNA\n\n\n26\n42\nold\n22\n\n\n27\n73\nnew\nNA\n\n\n28\n25\nold\n20\n\n\n29\n90\nnew\nNA\n\n\n30\n87\nnew\nNA\n\n\n31\n75\nold\n28\n\n\n32\n74\nnew\nNA\n\n\n33\n92\nold\n16\n\n\n34\n88\nnew\nNA\n\n\n35\n16\nnew\nNA\n\n\n36\n50\nnew\nNA\n\n\n37\n12\nold\n35\n\n\n38\n22\nnew\nNA\n\n\n39\n1\nnew\nNA\n\n\n40\n99\nnew\nNA\n\n\n41\n38\nnew\nNA\n\n\n42\n76\nnew\nNA\n\n\n43\n79\nnew\nNA\n\n\n44\n78\nnew\nNA\n\n\n45\n73\nold\n18\n\n\n46\n89\nnew\nNA\n\n\n47\n3\nnew\nNA\n\n\n48\n74\nold\n16\n\n\n49\n7\nnew\nNA\n\n\n50\n35\nnew\nNA\n\n\n51\n36\nnew\nNA\n\n\n52\n39\nnew\nNA\n\n\n53\n45\nnew\nNA\n\n\n54\n72\nnew\nNA\n\n\n55\n7\nold\n6\n\n\n56\n49\nnew\nNA\n\n\n57\n28\nnew\nNA\n\n\n58\n68\nnew\nNA\n\n\n59\n33\nnew\nNA\n\n\n60\n65\nnew\nNA\n\n\n61\n57\nnew\nNA\n\n\n62\n91\nnew\nNA\n\n\n63\n57\nold\n2\n\n\n64\n77\nnew\nNA\n\n\n65\n2\nnew\nNA\n\n\n66\n41\nnew\nNA\n\n\n67\n13\nnew\nNA\n\n\n68\n30\nnew\nNA\n\n\n69\n47\nnew\nNA\n\n\n70\n59\nnew\nNA\n\n\n71\n54\nold\n62\n\n\n72\n81\nnew\nNA\n\n\n73\n14\nnew\nNA\n\n\n74\n35\nold\n24\n\n\n75\n69\nold\n61\n\n\n76\n33\nold\n17\n\n\n77\n11\nold\n66\n\n\n78\n89\nold\n32\n\n\n79\n60\nnew\nNA\n\n\n80\n9\nold\n57\n\n\n81\n5\nnew\nNA\n\n\n82\n37\nnew\nNA\n\n\n83\n64\nnew\nNA\n\n\n84\n56\nnew\nNA\n\n\n85\n94\nnew\nNA\n\n\n86\n16\nold\n51\n\n\n87\n24\nnew\nNA\n\n\n88\n40\nold\n63\n\n\n89\n37\nold\n7\n\n\n90\n60\nold\n11\n\n\n91\n87\nold\n61\n\n\n92\n83\nnew\nNA\n\n\n93\n20\nnew\nNA\n\n\n94\n100\nnew\nNA\n\n\n95\n45\nold\n42\n\n\n96\n34\nnew\nNA\n\n\n97\n55\nnew\nNA\n\n\n98\n4\nold\n82\n\n\n99\n84\nold\n93\n\n\n100\n88\nold\n66\n\n\n101\n23\nnew\nNA\n\n\n102\n72\nold\n48\n\n\n103\n50\nold\n67\n\n\n104\n36\nold\n53\n\n\n105\n68\nold\n47\n\n\n106\n64\nold\n23\n\n\n107\n46\nnew\nNA\n\n\n108\n29\nnew\nNA\n\n\n109\n14\nold\n36\n\n\n110\n95\nnew\nNA\n\n\n111\n56\nold\n27\n\n\n112\n70\nold\n107\n\n\n113\n28\nold\n56\n\n\n114\n61\nnew\nNA\n\n\n115\n96\nold\n95\n\n\n116\n93\nnew\nNA\n\n\n117\n18\nnew\nNA\n\n\n118\n5\nold\n37\n\n\n119\n46\nold\n12\n\n\n120\n22\nold\n82\n\n\n121\n86\nnew\nNA\n\n\n122\n19\nnew\nNA\n\n\n123\n79\nold\n80\n\n\n124\n39\nold\n72\n\n\n125\n29\nold\n17\n\n\n126\n62\nnew\nNA\n\n\n127\n98\nold\n115\n\n\n128\n48\nold\n109\n\n\n129\n47\nold\n60\n\n\n130\n10\nnew\nNA\n\n\n131\n38\nold\n90\n\n\n132\n41\nold\n66\n\n\n133\n100\nold\n39\n\n\n134\n26\nnew\nNA\n\n\n135\n53\nnew\nNA\n\n\n136\n81\nold\n64\n\n\n137\n95\nold\n27\n\n\n138\n63\nnew\nNA\n\n\n139\n18\nold\n22\n\n\n140\n66\nnew\nNA\n\n\n141\n83\nold\n49\n\n\n142\n63\nold\n4\n\n\n143\n27\nnew\nNA\n\n\n144\n58\nnew\nNA\n\n\n145\n65\nold\n85\n\n\n146\n51\nnew\nNA\n\n\n147\n91\nold\n85\n\n\n148\n26\nold\n14\n\n\n149\n94\nold\n64\n\n\n150\n3\nold\n103\n\n\n151\n97\nnew\nNA\n\n\n152\n1\nold\n113\n\n\n153\n51\nold\n7\n\n\n154\n20\nold\n61\n\n\n155\n30\nold\n87\n\n\n156\n32\nold\n146\n\n\n157\n44\nnew\nNA\n\n\n158\n21\nold\n145\n\n\n159\n78\nold\n115\n\n\n160\n44\nold\n3\n\n\n161\n17\nnew\nNA\n\n\n162\n43\nnew\nNA\n\n\n163\n62\nold\n37\n\n\n164\n59\nold\n94\n\n\n165\n31\nnew\nNA\n\n\n166\n71\nnew\nNA\n\n\n167\n53\nold\n32\n\n\n168\n80\nold\n144\n\n\n169\n61\nold\n55\n\n\n170\n97\nold\n19\n\n\n171\n71\nold\n5\n\n\n172\n49\nold\n116\n\n\n173\n19\nold\n51\n\n\n174\n85\nnew\nNA\n\n\n175\n93\nold\n59\n\n\n176\n34\nold\n80\n\n\n177\n58\nold\n33\n\n\n178\n52\nold\n157\n\n\n179\n90\nold\n150\n\n\n180\n2\nold\n115\n\n\n181\n55\nold\n84\n\n\n182\n23\nold\n81\n\n\n183\n6\nold\n176\n\n\n184\n99\nold\n144\n\n\n185\n67\nnew\nNA\n\n\n186\n10\nold\n56\n\n\n187\n31\nold\n22\n\n\n188\n17\nold\n27\n\n\n189\n86\nold\n68\n\n\n190\n66\nold\n50\n\n\n191\n67\nold\n6\n\n\n192\n15\nold\n177\n\n\n193\n82\nold\n175\n\n\n194\n24\nold\n107\n\n\n195\n27\nold\n52\n\n\n196\n85\nold\n22\n\n\n197\n13\nold\n130\n\n\n198\n43\nold\n36\n\n\n199\n77\nold\n135\n\n\n200\n76\nold\n158\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also look at the distribution of lags for old items.

The beginning shouldn’t be mostly new items, and the end shouldn’t be mostly old.\nMore control over the lags between first and second presentation of an item. For example, all items might have a minimum lag of 50 or greater.\n\nI’ll be working on solutions to this problem, and feel free to try your own as your work for this week. The solution to this type of problem requires an algorithm for mixing the items, and then some analysis of the sequence to show that it expresses the desired properties.\nOne of the papers in our zotero group library used a continuous recognition procedure, and their method section describes an approach that involves “test” items, and “filler” items.
