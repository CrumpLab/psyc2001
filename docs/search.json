The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\nMissing an Exam\nNote there are no exams in this course.\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nGeneral Help with Research and Writing\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

For this course, and at this stage, it is also fine if you obtain my example code and demonstrate that you can get it working on your quarto blog (e.g., produce a link that runs the experiment.)\nBrainstorm a manipulation that you think might change the size of the Stroop effect. For example, would making the color words bigger make it even harder to ignore the words, and therefore produce a larger Stroop effect (compared to trials where the words were much smaller and harder to read, and therefore easier to ignore)?\nProduce a version of the Stroop experiment that deploys your manipulation. In the example above, you would need to have some trials where the word appears in a small font and others where it appears in a large font.\n\n\nAdvanced\nWe will cover data analysis next week, but if you want to find out whether your manipulation worked, then you will need to analyze your data in each condition. See if you can find a way to do this. Did your manipulation succesfully cause a change in the size of the Stroop effect?"

Show that you can conduct the analysis in your blog post.\nCreate pilot data from your own Stroop experiment by running yourself as a participant a few times.\nAnalyse the data in R by modifying the example scripts as necessary."
