Every week this blog will be a place where you place your work (along with making notes for yourself about what you are doing).\nWe will use R, R Studio, Quarto, and Github to create the blog. These very same tools will be used for several other purposes including coding experiments and analyzing data from them.\nThis post contains instructions for getting a quarto blog up and running. If you can’t get something to work and have spend more than 30 minutes trying to solve the problem, then please email me and I will help you!"

The most current version of the syllabus is always available from the course website.\n\n\nMissing an Exam\nNote there are no exams in this course.\nIn the event of an emergency, contact me as soon as possible. If you are missing an exam for religious reasons refer to the state law regarding non-attendance because of religious beliefs noted in the front matter of the Undergraduate Bulletin and Graduate Bulletin. These may be found on the Academic Calendars, Course Schedules, and Bulletins page of the Registrar’s website. See also the student bereavement policy at http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/web/about/initiatives/policies/bereavement.php.\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nIn order to receive disability-related academic accommodations students must first be registered with the Center for Student Disability Services. Students who have a documented disability or suspect they may have a disability are invited to set up an appointment with the Director of the Center for Student Disability Services, at 718-951-5538. If you have already registered with the Center for Student Disability Services, please provide your professor with the course accommodation form and discuss your specific accommodation with him/her.\n\n\n\nGeneral Help with Research and Writing\nThe Library maintains a collection of links to sites that can assist you with proper citation format and paraphrasing and quoting other authors at Research & Writing Help. The Learning Center has writing tutors available to help you with your writing http://lc.brooklyn.cuny.edu/.\nThe best learning is done in conversation with others, whether they are people—classmates, teachers, friends—or texts—books, articles, essays, poems, films etc. It should not be a solitary process. However, the assignments that you hand in for this course must be done on your own, should represent your own thinking, and should be original work that you have done for this particular course. A good way to balance these two seemingly contradictory approaches (collaborative learning and original individually-produced work) without knowingly—or, even unwittingly—resorting to plagiarism or other forms of academic misconduct is to learn and meticulously observe the rules for citing the work of others (this could be the great point your roommate made that you used in your paper, it could be a well-turned phrase from an academic essay, or it could be anything in between). It is your responsibility to learn what constitutes plagiarism and the correct rules for citing sources—read the information on the following website carefully: http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/bc/policies/. The bottom line is: passing off anyone’s words or ideas as your own for any reason whatsoever is plagiarism."

For example, I’ll often use a blog post as a scratch pad to take notes or make observations about something that I’m trying to learn about. These notes often become helpful for me later on. I suggest that you write a blog post that contains notes about setting up your blog. This could include questions you have, notes about something that didn’t work, or ideas for things about the site you might want to change later."
