<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>As we discussed in our meeting a goal for this week is for everyone to get a Quarto blog up and running. You will use this throughout the semester as a lab journal. Every week this blog will be a place where you place your work (along with making notes for yourself about what you are doing).</p>
<p>We will use R, R Studio, Quarto, and Github to create the blog. These very same tools will be used for several other purposes including coding experiments and analysing data from them.</p>
<p>This post contains instructions for getting a quarto blog up and running. If you canâ€™t get something to work and have spend more than 30 minutes trying to solve the problem, then please email me and I will help you!</p>
<section id="setting-up-your-quarto-blog" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-your-quarto-blog">Setting up your quarto blog</h2>
<p>I wrote a whole blog post about how to do this a year ago. Here is the link. All of the steps should still work. The blog post has a video walkthrough that may be helpful as well.</p>

<section id="send-me-your-github-repo" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="send-me-your-github-repo">Send me your github repo</h2>
<p>If you get everything working, then you will have a github repository for your blog. Please send me the URL for this repository once you have it. We will be sharing code over github throughout this course.</p>
<p>For example, the github repo for this course website is:</p>
