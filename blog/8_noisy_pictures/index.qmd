Throughout the rest of the semester we will be developing experiments around the theme of recognition memory for pictures. 

This week there are two goals. 

1. I will be programming a new experiment to measure how recognition memory for pictures varies as visual noise is added to the pictures. I will be sharing my code as we go. After I am finished I will share a link to the experiment with everyone and ask you to attempt the experiment. We will then look at the pilot data and discuss the experimental design. 

2. In addition, this week the main assignment is to do some additional reading on the topic of recognition memory for degraded pictures. 

You can choose to read and take notes on one of these papers, or you can do a literature search to see if you can find any additional papers that manipulate picture quality (by adding noise, changing size, blurring, etc.). If you do a literature search then take notes on the new papers that you found.
