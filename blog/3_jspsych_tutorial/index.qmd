## Assignment

1. Show that you can get the JsPsych simple RT demo working and posted to your blog. You should be able to do this based on following along with the documentation and the screencast.

2. Generalize: The reading about Donder's concept of processing stages discussed three kinds of tasks
  a. A basic detection task
  b. A Go/NO-GO task
  c. A choice reaction time task
  
Your assignment is to attempt to produce scripts for each of these tasks by modifying the example simple RT demo script.
